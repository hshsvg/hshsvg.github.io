# which day do you like best in a week?

I like Friday best because I can go home on Friday. I study in a residential school and live in school from Monday till Friday. On Friday, I can stay with my family. That's a great time.

The second reason is that I have a psychology/saiˈkɔlədʒi/ class on Friday. It's interesting and exciting for me to have the psychology classes. Psychology is my favorite subject.
