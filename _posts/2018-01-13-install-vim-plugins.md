# Process

1. Install ruby.
   when gem install I found gem doesn't work with https. Then I change the source. Try to use http instead of https.

2. Install vim plugins
   I installed a little bit vim plugins in order to preview the markdown file when I edit it. 
   
   Finally I chose [this one](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.vim). And open firefox as the default browser. 

   One thing is very strange. I can preview by commands but can't by shortcut keys.



# End
