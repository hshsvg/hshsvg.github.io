# 世界上最适合居住的地方

Where is the best place to live in the world? The official answer is Norway. The United Nations released the Human Development Index of 188 countries on Dec 16. The index is based on people's life expectancy, level of education and income. The top 10 on the list are all Western countries, while the bottom there are all African countries with Niger coming in at the last place. China ranks 90th.

According to the UN the world is changing very fast in this digital era, which creates winners as well as losers. To achieve global development, one important measure is to help make more jobs in poor countries.
