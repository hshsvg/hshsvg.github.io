# Do you want to live on a houseboat?

I want to live on a houseboat because I think it's very special. Sometimes I want to have a trip to someplace. If I live on a houseboat, I can use it. I can see a lot of scenery. Maybe I travel to Castle Eden, maybe to Japan, Maybe to some other places.
when the trip is finished, I will be very happy and tired. I need to relax myself. But I need not worry. Though the houseboat is so small, It is fully functional/全功能的/. I can entertain myself on my houseboat. 

I want to live on a houseboat. Do you?

这里生活在船上用live on 还是live in? 再问下老师.
